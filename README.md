Day 2 â€“ Introduction to Arduino UNO and LED Programming
On the second day of our robotics training, we were introduced to the Arduino UNO microcontroller board. We learned about its key components such as digital and analog pins, USB interface, and power supply. As our first hands-on task, we wrote a simple Arduino sketch to light up an LED using a digital output pin. This basic exercise helped us understand how to write, upload, and execute code using the Arduino IDE as well as how to control output devices like LEDs through programming.The circuit design for lightning the led is link:https://www.tinkercad.com/things/13gcO3lBO8t-grand-duup?sharecode=MUNizlEfYXS-9h5BcpwvKQHPfiA8Ojbh13uwlInxjBs
